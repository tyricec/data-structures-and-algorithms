# Data Structures & Algorithms in JS #

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and data structures described in the book *Data Structures in C++ using the Standard Template Library*. I used this book in my college course *Data Structures* and was curious to see if I can redo some of the algorithms and structures in JS.

Caveat: Not sure how relavent the information provided in this book is. In the future, maybe these solutions will be revisited with other resources in mind.
